# markdown-live-editor

I'm starting only his adventure with markdown, because I wanted to have the possibility of real-time testing its syntax.
With a script by [evilstreak](https://github.com/evilstreak) wrote a very simple implementation. The whole is not complicated, and the biggest job was done just [evilstreak](https://github.com/evilstreak). Thanks
